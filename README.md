# AndroidBase

**AndroidBase** is a custom project tailored for my personal development needs. It aims to provide convenient solutions for daily development tasks. Please note that using this library comes with certain limitations and risks. Evaluate carefully whether it suits your requirements.

1. The code in this project is structured according to personal preferences and may not be suitable for all use cases or developers.
2. To reduce development overhead, some common methods may lack detailed documentation.
3. The project has not undergone comprehensive testing and may exhibit issues in unforeseen scenarios. Using it blindly could lead to unexpected problems during your app's runtime.
4. This project is released under the **GPL-3.0 license**. Projects that use this library must also remain open source.
5. If you still wish to use this library, consider using [AndroidWidget][AndroidWidgetLibrary] instead. `AndroidWidget` is the core dependency of this project, and most of its features are built upon it. Hopefully, it can better meet your needs.
